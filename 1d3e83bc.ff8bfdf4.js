The precision of the numbers is going to lead us astray, so I'll multiple 1.33 (to cover the rest of the year) and round up to 700,000,000 to cover a surge in holidays.  This represents a 2.5% increase over 2017, but let's set an upper bound.  If we assume 700,000,000 books a year from 2015 (publication date) and today we're at 2.8B books.  Now, in 2018 206,312,000 were adult non-fiction, which is where our book fits.  This represents 43% of total sales.  Now, sadly our book doesn't make the top 50 of most important business books, but Amazon has it as #25 in Business Planning & Forecasting, and #30,063 overall.  Now, we're going to assume Amazon has a big enough sample size to smooth out anomalies.  This is already going too long, so we're going to make a poor choice and say, worst case, upper bound, that all of the top 30,000 books over 4 years sell the same amount.  This is probably grossly wrong, as I expect the 80/20 rule to come into effect.  If we take 2.8 billion / 30k we're at 93000 per place.  So, for the 4 years that puts us at 360,000 copies.
