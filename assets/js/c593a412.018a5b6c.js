Imagine that you're at a college party that a friend took you too.  There are 40 people there, and you know one of them.  How do you get to know more people?  Just going up and talking to people is emotionally hard.  Intro lines of \"What's your name?\" or \"Who do you know?\" or \"You look as awkward as I feel.\" all are tough.  I believe it's hard because of the implicit fear of rejection.  Not that someone is going to say \"Go away\" but that it will be so awkward that they don't want to talk to you ever again.
